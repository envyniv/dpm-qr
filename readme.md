# Export/Compile

## Exporting

Exporting from Godot will give you the GUI version.

## Compiling

While not suggested (Seriously, just use the script, it'll be fine.) you _can still_ package up the script into an executable, this will allow you to avoid installing python on the machine where this will be executed.
