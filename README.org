#+title: DPM QR Editor

_An HTML5 + ECMAScript 6 QR Code Editor for the "The Denpa Men" Game Series._

* Planned features

** Four modes of operation
*** TODO Denpa Men
*** TODO Denpa Men 2
*** TODO Denpa Men 3
*** TODO Plain Text
Basically just a JSON file in QR format. Can be enforced for all games

** Automatic mode switching
Plain text would be a toggle since no game uses it
*** TODO catalogue features based on game

** Flexible preview
*** TODO Assets
- If tropic allows us, we could use their picrew assets for the preview
- The scroll/paper svg comes from [[https://github.com/envyniv/freedpm][freedpm]]
*** TODO Game icon for QR Differentiation
The images should be embed at the center of the QRCode, and clearly visible.

** Encoded Data panel
A simple Textbox where we can show what has been put into the QRCode.

* Progress Report
UI is almost complete

* Resources used
- the [[https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR][jsQR]] library for reading QRCodes from images and camera
